with environmental problems and its applications.<br /><br />My PhD in theoretical ecology at the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/echo/">Laboratory of Ecohydrology</a> led by Prof. A.

The metapopulation concept is an abstraction of the concept of population, where an ensemble of interacting individuals is considered to a higher level, and where interacting subpopulations are considered.<br /><br />The specific metapopulation model used here is called Spatially-Explicit Stochastic Patch Occupancy Model (SPOM).<br /><br />Building on a grid with N cells, SPOM computes a possible distribution of occupied cells at every simulation time t by considering extinction and colonisation processes, whose rates depend on the species properties and on the landscape features. A binary state variable w<sub>i</sub> (t) is set to 1 when the cell i is occupied and 0 when empty (i = 1, ... , N).<br /><br />Starting from a given initial distribution of occupied cells, at each time step, the model allows unoccupied cells to be colonised by surrounding occupied cells with a certain probablity.<br /><br />Then, the cell becomes occupied at time t + ∆t depending on a random sample from a Bernoulli distribution. Similarly, species in occupied cells can go extinct with a certain probability. SPOM works as a Markov chain, where, for each cell, the probabilities of colonisation and extinction events are modelled depending on presence and conditions.<br /><br /><div class="ScienceInsert leftInsert" id="GPNPEOData"><a href="./Images/Science/GPNP/EOData.webm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><video autoplay="" loop="" width="100%"><source src="./Images/Science/GPNP/EOData.webm" type="video/webm"></video></a><span>Static and dynamic Earth Observation data used in the study to characterise the niche of the species in each pixel.</span></div><br /><br />In the context of this work, the colonisation and extinction probabilities are based on using Earth Observation data to characterise the niche of the species. <br /><br />The factors are combined in a non-linear logistic function to best describe the niche.<br /><br />The different EO factors are selected to best describe the environmental conditions relevant for the modeled species.<br /><br /><span id="ScienceSpacing"><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></span>The developed framework proposes a three step algorithm:<br />1.

We are currently developing <a href="https://Underwatertale.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hermit: an Underwater Tale</a>.<br /></div><h2>Backstory</h2>Game development started for me as a silly distraction and creative outlet in 2014 when Tristan Thévenoz approached me. Tristan is a classically educated artist, proficient in multiple forms of expression and passionate about the creative process. His love of video games led him to dabble in pixel art in 2013, and he was then looking for somebody to work with, on the technical aspect. This is when he approached me, and we soon became friends and started working on one silly project after the other.<br /><br />In our early days, we had the chance to get approached by an artist called <a href="https://www.francoisburland.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">François Burland</a>, who was interested in hiring us to create video games for his arts installation. Over the course of three years, under the umbrella of <a href="https://sharpedstonestudios.ch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sharped Stone Studios</a> , we participated in two different arts installation, each time trying to incorporate the essence of the artists' vision we were working with:<ul><li><b>SuperNova (2017)</b>, set in Martigny, a small town in the middle of the Alps in Switzerland, the exhibition focused on cultural landmarks in and around Martigny, reinterpreted by various artists. We developed <a href="https://itch.io/c/392769/supernova-martigny" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two games</a> dedicated to the pizza places and roundabouts, both very abundant in Martigny.</li><li><b>Atomic Bazar (2018 - 2019)</b>, set in Fribourg, this exhibition was set around François' vision of the cold war. We developed <a href="https://itch.io/c/379794/atomik-bazar">four games</a>, meant to encapsulate his vision and art into games.</li></ul><h2>Early Coffee Games</h2><a href="https://EarlyCoffee.Games" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Early Coffee Games</a> is a game development company based in Switzerland we created in 2020 with Tristan. The company is our step into semi-professional game development.<br /><br />Since its creation, the company can note a couple of successes:<ul><li>In 2020 we received the <b><a href="https://prohelvetia.ch" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">ProHelvetia</a> pre-production grant</b> for our debut game

The game is a fast paced action game with arcade elements. You play as a hermit crab who faces waves of creeps and dangerous sea creatures.<br /><br />In order to protect yourself and defeat your enemies, you will use a wide variety of empty shells as weapons. Each shell comes with a specific set of moves and attacks and will eventually break after use.<br /><br />Without any shell, the hermit is fully exposed and any damage he receives will be lethal. The game features a simple core mechanic paired with a high and ever increasing difficulty over multiple levels.<br /><br />In order to beat the game, you will have to combine skill, real-time resources management, smart item purchases, upgrade strategies and serious stamina in order to survive.<br /><br /><br /><br />Feel free to check it out and let us know what you think!</div><div class="HermitFrame"><iframe frameborder="0" height="190" src="https://store.steampowered.com/widget/1773740/" width="646"></iframe></div></div></div></div><div class="copyright">© 2022 Jonathan Giezendanner<br />Source code for this website avaialable under MIT Licence on <a href="https://github.com/GieziJo/GieziJo.github.io" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Github</a></div></div><script>var scrollFun = function() {(window.scrollY > 350) ? navigation.classList.add("activateNavigation"):navigation.classList.remove("activateNavigation")};</script><script>window.addEventListener("scroll", scrollFun);</script><script>scrollFun();</script></body></html>
