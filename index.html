We are currently developing <a href="https://Underwatertale.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hermit: an Underwater Tale</a>.<br /></div><h2>Backstory</h2>Game development started for me as a silly distraction and creative outlet in 2014 when Tristan Thévenoz approached me. Tristan is a classically educated artist, proficient in multiple forms of expression and passionate about the creative process. His love of video games led him to dabble in pixel art in 2013, and he was then looking for somebody to work with, on the technical aspect. This is when he approached me, and we soon became friends and started working on one silly project after the other.<br /><br />In our early days, we had the chance to get approached by an artist called <a href="https://www.francoisburland.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">François Burland</a>, who was interested in hiring us to create video games for his arts installation. Over the course of three years, under the umbrella of <a href="https://sharpedstonestudios.ch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sharped Stone Studios</a> , we participated in two different arts installation, each time trying to incorporate the essence of the artists' vision we were working with:<ul><li><b>SuperNova (2017)</b>, set in Martigny, a small town in the middle of the Alps in Switzerland, the exhibition focused on cultural landmarks in and around Martigny, reinterpreted by various artists. We developed <a href="https://itch.io/c/392769/supernova-martigny" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two games</a> dedicated to the pizza places and roundabouts, both very abundant in Martigny.</li><li><b>Atomic Bazar (2018 - 2019)</b>, set in Fribourg, this exhibition was set around François' vision of the cold war. We developed <a href="https://itch.io/c/379794/atomik-bazar">four games</a>, meant to encaplusalte his vision and art into games.</li></ul><h2>Early Coffee Games</h2><a href="https://EarlyCoffee.Games" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Early Coffee Games</a> is a game development company based in Switzerland we created in 2020 with Tristan. The company is our step into semi-professional game development.<br /><br />Since its creation, the company can note a couple of successes:<ul><li>In 2020 we received the <b><a href="https://prohelvetia.ch" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">ProHelvetia</a> pre-production grant</b> for our debut game 
 <a href='https://Underwatertale.com' target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Hermit: an Underwater Tale</a> (see below)
 . This allowed us to hire <a href="https://www.maneingreen.com/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Plume Oggier</a> for creating the game's music, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gwenbuord/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwen Buord</a> to produce the game's sounds, as well as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-fellay-41ba01ba/" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonathan Fellay</a> for the narrative part of the adventure. <a href="https://earlycoffee.games/ChroMaticRacing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class=rightInsert id=chromaticImage src="./Images/GameDev/chromatic.png"></a> </li><li>In 2021 the museum <a href="https://www.fr.ch/mahf/espace-jean-tinguely-niki-de-saint-phalle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Espace Jean-Tinguely Nicki de Saint Phalle</a> contracted us to create a unique art piece complementing their exhibition. We created <a href="https://earlycoffee.games/ChroMaticRacing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chromatic Racing</a>, an interactive piece, which invites the visitor to create a piece of art by playing the game. The piece is exposed form 2019 to 2024.</li><li>In 2022 we were selected for the Swiss delegation to go to the <a href="https://gdconf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Games Developers Conference (GDC)</a> in San-Francisco, where we showed Hermit.</li></ul>The main focus of the studio is currently to develop Hermit.</div></div><div id="Hermit"><div class="column"><a href="https://Underwatertale.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><div class="HermitLogo"><img src="./Images/GameDev/HermitLogo.png" /></div></a><br /><div class="HermitContent"><a href="https://Underwatertale.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hermit: an Underwater Tale</a> is currently the studio's main focus. The game is a fast paced action game with arcade elements. You play as a hermit crab who faces waves of creeps and dangerous sea creatures.<br /><br />In order to protect yourself and defeat your enemies, you will use a wide variety of empty shells as weapons. Each shell comes with a specific set of moves and attacks and will eventually break after use.<br /><br />Without any shell, the hermit is fully exposed and any damage he receives will be lethal. The game features a simple core mechanic paired with a high and ever increasing difficulty over multiple levels.<br /><br />In order to beat the game, you will have to combine skill, real-time resources management, smart item purchases, upgrade strategies and serious stamina in order to survive.<br /><br /><br /><br />Feel free to check it out and let us know what you think!</div><div class="HermitFrame"><iframe frameborder="0" height="190" src="https://store.steampowered.com/widget/1773740/" width="646"></iframe></div></div></div></div><div class="copyright">© 2022 Jonathan Giezendanner<br />Source code for this website avaialable under MIT Licence on <a href="https://github.com/GieziJo/GieziJo.github.io" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Github</a></div></div><script>var scrollFun = function() {(window.scrollY > 350) ? navigation.classList.add("activateNavigation"):navigation.classList.remove("activateNavigation")};</script><script>window.addEventListener("scroll", scrollFun);</script><script>scrollFun();</script></body></html>
