                        | While a lot of the recent machine learning methods have focused on reproducing global weather reanalysis and forecast models, a discrepensasy exists between the global models and local weather stations. 
                        | This project aims at downscaling global weather models to local scales, and even arbitrary locations, by combining global reanalysis data with local weather station data.

                        | To tackle this task, we first focus on forecasting the weather at fixed locations. We developed a series of deep learning models that take as input reanalysis data (ERA5/HRRR) and local weather station data (MADIS), and output a forecast for the next 24 hours at the location of the weather station.
