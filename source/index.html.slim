                    | Hobby game developer since 2014, I turned semi-professional in 2020 by co-founding

                h2 Backstory
                | Game development started for me as a silly distraction and creative outlet in 2014 when Tristan Thévenoz approached me. Tristan is a classically educated artist, proficient in multiple forms of expression and passionate about the creative process. His love of video games led him to dabble in pixel art in 2013, and he was then looking for somebody to work with, on the technical aspect. This is when he approached me, and we soon became friends and started working on one silly project after the other.
                br
                br
                | In our early days, we had the chance to get approached by an artist called 
                a href="" François Burland
                | , who was interested in hiring us to create video games for his arts installation. Over the course of three years, under the umbreall of 
                a href='https://sharpedstonestudios.ch' Sharped Stone Studios
                |  , we participated in two different arts installation, each time trying to incorportate the essence of the artits' vision we were working with:

                a href='https://EarlyCoffee.Games' Early Coffee Games
                |  is a game development company based in Switzerland we created in 2020 with Tristan. The company is our step into semi-professional game development.
                br
                br
                | Since its creation, the company can note a couple of successes:
                ul
                    li In 2020 we received the <b><a href="https://prohelvetia.ch">ProHelvetia</a> pre-production grant</b> for our debut game 
                        <a href='https://Underwatertale.com'>Hermit: an Underwater Tale</a> (see below)
                        . This allowed us to hire <a href="">Plume Oggier</a> for creating the game's music, <a href="">Gwen Buord</a> to produce the game's sounds, as well as <a href="">Jonathan Fellay</a> for the narrative part of the adventure. <a href=""><img class=rightInsert src="./Images/GameDev/chromatic.png"></a> 
                    li In 2021 the museum <a href="">Espace Jean-Tinguely Nicki de Saint Phalle</a> contatracted us to create a unique art piece complementing their exhibition. We created <a href="">Chromatic Racing</a>, an interactive piece, which invites the visitor to create a piece of art by playing the game. The piece is exposed form 2019 to 2024.
                    li In 2022 we were selected for the Swiss delegation to go to the <a>Games Developers Conference (GDC)</a> in San-Francisco, where we showed Hermit.
                | The main focus of the studio is currently to develop Hermit.

                a href='https://Underwatertale.com' Hermit: an Underwater Tale
                |  is currently the studio's main focus. 
                | The game is a fast paced action game with arcade elements. You play as a hermit crab who faces waves of creeps and dangerous sea creatures.
                br
                br
                | In order to protect yourself and defeat your enemies, you will use a wide variety of empty shells as weapons. Each shell comes with a specific set of moves and attacks and will eventually break after use.
                br
                br
                | Without any shell, the hermit is fully exposed and any damage he receives will be lethal. The game features a simple core mechanic paired with a high and ever increasing difficulty over multiple levels.
                br
                br
                | In order to beat the game, you will have to combine skill, real-time resources management, smart item purchases, upgrade strategies and serious stamina in order to survive.
